# AirDuino
*Space for code, images and pcb of the AirDuino Project*

## Context
The AirDuino (name pending) is a project of mine which displays air quality measurements such as CO2, nitrogen, dust and oxygen levels in the air. 
The project started as a simple Arduino script, and is evolving as my skills do. 
eg, I aim to eventually write my own scripts for the SPI OLED screen display.
